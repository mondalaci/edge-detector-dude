Edge Detector Dude
==================

Edge Detector Dude is a sweet and simple graphics utility as can be
seen on the following screenshot:



It computes and renders the Sobel edge-detected and
the gradient-directed versions of the input image.  The pixels of the
gradient-directed image are computed by denoting the angle of the
gradient of the pixels and mapping their value as a grayscale color.

Edge Detector Dude is actually a front end that uses the accompanying
gradient utility that processes the input image.

Edge Detector Dude is written in Python using PyGTK GUI library.
gradient is written in C using the Allegro game programming library.
