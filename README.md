Edge Detector Dude is a simple image manipulation application written
in Python using PyGTK.  It presents you the Sobel edge-detected and
the gradient-directed versions of the input image.  The pixels of the
gradient-directed image is computed by denoting the angle of the
gradient of the pixel and mapping this value as a grayscale color.

Edge Detector Dude is more accurately a front end that uses the
accompanying gradient utility to process the input image and visualize
its result images.

gradient is written in C using the Allegro game programming library.
