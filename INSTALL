Build
=====

To build gradient, you'll need the Allegro developer library.  In
Debian the liballegro-dev package contains just this.  After having
the dependencies installed you can easily build gradient by invoking
make.

You don't have to build Edge Detector Dude, since it's a Python
application however you'll need to have the PyGTK and the Python Glade
packages installed which are named in Debian as the python-gtk2 and
python-glade2 packages.

Install
=======

Copy the package directory to any place you want.  After that modify
the program_dir variable in the beginning of the edge-detector-dude.py
file to reflect the actual pathname of the application.

You can invoke Edge Detector Dude from any place from this moment on.
